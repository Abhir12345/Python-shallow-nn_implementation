# Python-shallow-nn_implementation
Implement a single layered neural network for a classification problem in python.

This is a notebook consisting of a simple single layered NN on the make_moons() dataset of scikit-learn. All the step-wise functions have been implemented, untill the evaluation measures for the NN (accuracy, and the confusion matrix) from the scikit-learn library.
